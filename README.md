# snippet

Command will output a common example snippet of code as directed.  
Time saver for things I use/forget often that I don't want to go lookup in a browser.

Supported languages:
- a=ansible
- b=bash
- p=python
- m=markdown

## Install
```
cp snippet /usr/local/bin
```

## Usage

I commonly alias `snippet` to `s` to cut down on typing: 
```
alias s='snippet'
```

Examples:
```
s a file
s b case
s p print
s m link
```
